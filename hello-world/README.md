# hello-world

Hey guys, Hector here.

This is my first time using git-hub and I'm using this to introduce myself as a tip from the "Hello World - GitHub Guide" and tell a little bit about me.

So... , my name is Hector Queiróz, I'm from São Paulo - Brazil, 20-year-old, I'm into games (Just like any other with 20yrs that uses PC every day), fantasy books, my favorite music genre at the moment would be trap, but also interested into electronic,rap, and some love songs. Oh, I almost forget, used to like of animes and this kind of stuff when were younger but isn't my thing today, but somethings are still from the japan world are still attached to me, just like the songs. I still intend to learn japanesse all by myself, but recently got stuck in the part were everyone gets when face it that are the famous "Kanji's".

So.. enough about what I like, I currently learning to be full-stack programmer, still in beginning though. Learning how to code in HTML,CSS,JS (The basics if you can say that HTML and CSS are something that you code, but..), I'm being taught PHP too, the back-end part of full-stack was way much easier too me than front-end,not that were a piece of cake but still easier.

I'm looking to learn enough to get a job in the programming world, doesn't matter if ain't with those languages that I quote above. I willing (and excited) to learn new things.

And for last,as you can see, my native language isn't english. As I came from Brazil, my native language is portuguese. And not used to typing long texts like this, so sorry for any gramaticall errors.

If you want to reach me to discuss whatever you want you can email to hectorqrs@gmail.com. Promise to answer in 24 hours.
See ya.
